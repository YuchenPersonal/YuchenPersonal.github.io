# About Me
Hello, my name is Yuchen Mei. I'm a video game programmer.
# How I Got Started
My undergraduate subject was management which I didn't really like so I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript and creating websites in my spare uni time. I picked web programming because there's a competition and I wanted to create a website to share handwriting notes.<br />
On my second uni year's summer holiday I took some web programming lessons with two teachers in Beijing and they not only taught me web programming knowledge but also said to me that JavaScript is popular and useful but if you want to go further on this coding path, you need a solid foundation of programming. So after going back to uni, I started teaching myself C, Linux, Discrete math and some other topics that a CS student would learn in the classroom.
