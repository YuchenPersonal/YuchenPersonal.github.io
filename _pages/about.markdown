# About Me
Hello, my name is Yuchen Mei. I'm a video game programmer.

# How I Got Started
My undergraduate subject was management which I didn't really like so I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript and creating websites in my spare uni time. I picked web programming because there's a competition and I wanted to create a website to share handwriting notes.<br />

On my second uni year's summer holiday I took some web programming lessons with two teachers in Beijing and they not only taught me web programming knowledge but also said to me that JavaScript is popular and useful but if you want to go further on this coding path, you need a solid foundation of programming. So after going back to uni, I started teaching myself C, Linux, Discrete math and some other topics that a CS student would learn in the classroom.

In my fourth year at uni (2014), I got a job in Beijing as a mobile game programmer. The guy who interviewed me was Tao and I still keep in touch with him. The game project I worked on was originally written in a web framework whose performance was not enough to keep it running at even 30 FPS so they decided to rewrite the game in cocos2d-js which is a game engine with core functionalities written in C++ and game logic APIs callable by javascript. The game was called HeiBaiDao and it's a card mobile game so it was very UI heavy. I still recall today (4th of March 2024) that my first task was to create a strategy/framework so that we only need to set the UI elements' locations in a standard resolution (720x1280) and they can be adjusted to the correct locations/sizes automatically in different mobile resolutions. This was crucial because mobile phones have a lot of different sizes/resolutions. The engineering leader even told me that if I can come up with something then I'll be the person who's in charge of it. If I can't figure out a way they'll hire someone with more experience to do it and let me led by them.
I was very struggled to propose a solution for this task and I even questioned myself whether I have what it takes to be a programmer. Why wouldn't I just go and become a driver like my dad so I don't have to worry about not being able to complete a task. Luckily I was able to come up with a solution and I was the main programmer for all the game UI.
